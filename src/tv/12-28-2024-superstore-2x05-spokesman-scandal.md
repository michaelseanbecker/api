![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/002/308/707/screenshots/thumb/2d992bcf58.jpg)When Cloud 9's spokesman is accused of a heinous crime, Glenn worries that he doesn't know enough about his employees and Dina exploits his concerns by carrying out storewide drug testing. Meanwhile, Amy and Jonah have a fun, flirty day avoiding work and daring each other with a series of pranks; Cheyenne can't stop talking about her baby, which annoys Garrett ; and Mateo continues to look for romance in his ambiguous relationship with Jeff.
