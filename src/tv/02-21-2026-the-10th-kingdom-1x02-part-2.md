# The 10th Kingdom  1x02 "Part 2"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/000/878/380/screenshots/thumb/d6a8a74c35.jpg)Tony is imprisoned in Snow White Memorial Prison, and Virginia breaks him out with the help of a half-wolf who has fallen in love with her. Tony and Virginia are torn between trying to find their way home and helping Prince Wendell defeat the Evil Queen. Trolls working for the Queen chase them throughout the nine kingdoms, and they soon realize that the land of fairy tales is not what it used to be; the age of "happily ever after" is long gone.
