# Christmas Cookie Challenge  7x02 "Redemption"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/010/971/083/screenshots/thumb/cfcde8986d.jpg)It's redemption day in the workshop as hosts Ree Drummond and Eddie Jackson welcome back cookie makers who came up just short of winning their first time around. They'll decorate cookies that call back to forgotten Christmas traditions and characters using a classic cookie that's hard to master -- snickerdoodle! Two cookie makers will experience the ultimate heartbreak, while one will gain an advantage for the second round. The three remaining cookie makers reveal what makes them tick as they construct massive 360-degree Christmas grandfather clocks featuring timely ingredients like instant coffee, instant pudding mix, sloe gin and thyme. The cookie maker who makes the most titanic timepiece will earn redemption and a $10,000 prize.
