# K.C. Undercover  1x09 "Spy-anoia Will Destroy Ya"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/001/678/967/screenshots/thumb/1243e5e73c.jpg)When K.C's somewhat awkward brother brings home a super gorgeous girlfriend, K.C is convinced that she's really a spy. She tries everything to get her to open up, including handcuffing her to an armchair and 'tickle-tasering' her. When nothing works, K.C pretends to talk to someone on her spy bracelet, saying that she'll get the 'important files' in her locker at school. Overhearing K.C's pretend conversation and thinking it was real, Jolie follows K.C to school where they end up having a fight. K.C manages to knock Jolie out with gas from her bracelet. Because Jolie was only Ernie's girlfriend for info about their family, K.C gets her to tell Ernie that she's going to be the first teen in space and must begin her training the next day. Jolie leaves forever and K.C then makes up with her brother and shows him her new earrings that she stole from Jolie.
