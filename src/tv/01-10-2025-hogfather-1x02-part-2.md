# Hogfather  1x02 "Part 2"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/001/456/105/screenshots/thumb/42183ebfa8.jpg)Lord Downey, the Head of The Assassins’ Guild, is approached with a proposal: enlist the ruthless Mr. Teatime to kill the Hogfather. When the Hogfather disappears, Death is summoned to fill the fat man’s shoes, and a further plan to outwit the Auditors is underway. But who can stop them? Death’s adopted granddaughter and mild-mannered governess Susan Sto-Helit? Mustrum Ridcully, Head of the Unseen University? Ridcully’s motley band of wizards? Hex, the thinking engine?
