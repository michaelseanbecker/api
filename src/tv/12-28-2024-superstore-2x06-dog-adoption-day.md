# Superstore  2x06 "Dog Adoption Day"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/002/313/955/screenshots/thumb/01d6319423.jpg)After new parents Cheyenne and Bo get into a fight, Amy and Glenn take vastly different approaches in giving them advice. Meanwhile, Mateo and Jonah get assigned to handle dog adoptions in the store and work feverishly to get all of the dogs adopted once they find out what will happen to the dogs if they don't. Dina refuses to adjust Garrett's timecard based on "store rules," leaving Garrett happy to taunt Dina in revenge.
