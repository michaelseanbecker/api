# The Great British Bake Off  9x09 "Patisserie Week"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/013/452/302/screenshots/thumb/0d885c95aa.jpg)Alison Hammond and Noel Fielding present as the semi-finalists take on patisserie week, serving up cream horns and tackling a recipe for a sugar glass dome in the technical round. In the showstopper, they produce a macaron sculpture that depicts something meaningful to them, before judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood decide who will be going through to the final.
