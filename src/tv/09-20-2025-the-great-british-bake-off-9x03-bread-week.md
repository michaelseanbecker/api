# The Great British Bake Off  9x03 "Bread Week"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/013/429/514/screenshots/thumb/7788eb611d.jpg)The bakers are hoping for a Hollywood handshake this week as they tackle bread, the steely-eyed judge's specialty. They begin by putting their stamp on a pull-apart monkey bread in the signature challenge, before being asked to make a sticky, messy, fast food technical. For the showstopper, they serve up sweet bread in tiers. Sadly, for one baker, this will be their last day in the tent. Who will be dusting themselves off and hanging up their apron?
