# Superstore  2x01 "Olympics"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/002/045/557/screenshots/thumb/6c178648ec.jpg)A Cloud 9 Olympics promotion gives Amy the chance to meet her childhood hero, gold medal-winning gymnast Missy Jones. Meanwhile, storewide "Olympic fever" causes Glenn to have some difficulty balancing his extreme patriotism, Jonah to learn a secret about Mateo's past and Dina strives to create a "closing ceremony" her colleagues will never forget. This was released as a special during 2016 Olympics before season 2 premiere.
