To help her get into the festive spirit, she welcomes celebrity sewers the Rev Kate Bottley, Antony Cotton, Kiell Smith-Bynoe and Anneka Rice into the Sewing Room. Under the watchful eye of judges Esme Young and Patrick Grant, the four brave celebrities follow a pattern for a Christmas jumper, transform a charity shop bundle into fancy dress outfits and create dresses from Christmas past.
