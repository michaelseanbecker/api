# Sense and Sensibility  1x01 "Part 1"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/000/516/468/screenshots/thumb/2376b0e6b3.jpg)Upon Mr. Dashwood's death the entirety of his estate passes, by law, to his son John from his first marriage, leaving his widow and daughters entirely dependent on the latter's reluctant generosity. Now mere guests in their own home, Mr. Dashwood's daughters meet visiting relative-in-law Edward Ferrars. He and eldest daughter Elinor Dashwood are drawn to each other, but Elinor learns Edward's inheritance is conditioned on his marrying wellâ€”and knows her relative poverty disqualifies her.
