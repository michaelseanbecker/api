![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/006/558/466/screenshots/thumb/a6f79d858a.jpg)Princess Rhaenyra dives deep into the prophecies about House Targaryen while confronting a realm that resists the idea of a woman on the Iron Throne, and Prince Daemon, embittered over being passed over as the heir to Westeros, prepares to go to war.
