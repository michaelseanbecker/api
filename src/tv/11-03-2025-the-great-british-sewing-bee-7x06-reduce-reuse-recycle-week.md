# The Great British Sewing Bee  7x06 "Reduce Reuse Recycle Week"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/005/147/134/screenshots/thumb/0aac1b7637.jpg)The fashion industry is the biggest polluter of our planet next to oil, so The Great British Sewing Bee returns to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle Week, with all the usual fabric in the haberdashery being replaced with charity shop clothes and soft-furnishings. Host Joe Lycett kicks the six remaining home sewers off with a pattern for a gentleman’s waistcoat using just second-hand clothes. In the Transformation Challenge, the sewers are tasked with changing items of army surplus into a stylish and wearable garment for a woman. Finally, the sewers are asked to use old jeans to create a Made to Measure dress. Jeans are one of the most polluting garments to manufacture, so to breathe a new lease of life into them, each sewer must create a new denim dress that fits their model perfectly. At the end, someone will win Garment of the Week, and a sixth sewer will be asked to leave the Sewing Bee.
