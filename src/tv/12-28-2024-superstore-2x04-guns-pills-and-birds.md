# Superstore  2x04 "Guns, Pills and Birds"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/002/308/706/screenshots/thumb/3eea805499.jpg)When Amy assigns an uncomfortable Jonah to the gun section of Cloud 9, Jonah abuses his right-to-refuse sale to anyone that causes concern, causing an open-carry protest to gather in the store. On principle, Glenn attempts to purchase all of the store's morning-after pills, but finds himself in a moral dilemma when he can't afford them. Dina, Garrett and Mateo hunt down a crow that has flown into the store.
