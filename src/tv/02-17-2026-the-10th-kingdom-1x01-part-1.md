# The 10th Kingdom  1x01 "Part 1"

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/episodes/000/878/378/screenshots/thumb/576a35f2fb.jpg)Thanks to Relish the Troll King, the Evil Queen is once again free, and she has a trap ready for Prince Wendell. Her dog transforms into Prince Wendell and Prince Wendell becomes a dog. While trying to escape, the real Prince Wendell accidentally turns on a magic mirror, and runs away into 10th kingdom. Virginia hits him with her bicycle, feeling bad about hitting a dog; she takes him to work with her. Wolf and Relish the Troll Kings kids are after the real Prince, and they are looking all over New York for him.
