Stand-up comedian Patton Oswalt, SNL legend Rachel Dratch, comedian Leslie Jones, and actor-comedian Adam Pally whisk, bake, and decorate their way through three hair-raising Halloween baking challenges. From creepy confections to ghoulishly creative desserts, these stars will put their baking skills to the test. Only one will scare up a win and claim the Star Baker title.
