# The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Extended) (2001)

![](https://walter.trakt.tv/images/movies/000/210/288/fanarts/thumb/2c9ae83c96.jpg)Assisted by a Fellowship of heroes, Frodo Baggins plunges into a perilous trek to take the mystical One Ring to Mount Doom so that it and its magical powers can be destroyed and never possessed by evil Lord Sauron. The astonishing journey begins in the first film of director/co-writer Peter Jackson's epic trilogy that redefined fantasy film making. This imaginative foray into J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth won 4 Academy Awards and earned 13 total nominations, including best picture.
