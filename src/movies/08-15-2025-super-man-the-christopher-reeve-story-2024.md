# Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story (2024)

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/movies/000/908/306/fanarts/thumb/2ee252ce96.jpg)Christopher Reeve portrayed the Man of Steel in four Superman films and played dozens of other roles that displayed his talent and range as an actor, before being injured in a near-fatal horse-riding accident in 1995 that left him paralyzed from the neck down. After becoming a quadriplegic, he became a charismatic leader and activist in the quest to find a cure for spinal cord injuries, as well as a passionate advocate for disability rights and care.
