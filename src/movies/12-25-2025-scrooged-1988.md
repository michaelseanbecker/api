![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/movies/000/004/923/fanarts/thumb/e325188a65.jpg)Frank Cross is a wildly successful television executive whose cold ambition and curmudgeonly nature has driven away the love of his life. But after firing a staff member on Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by a series of ghosts who give him a chance to re-evaluate his actions and right the wrongs of his past.
