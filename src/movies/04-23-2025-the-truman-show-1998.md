# The Truman Show (1998)

![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/movies/000/023/734/fanarts/thumb/5bc40f3587.jpg)Every second of every day, from the moment he was born, for the last thirty years, Truman Burbank has been the unwitting star of the longest running, most popular documentary-soap opera in history. The picture-perfect town of Seahaven that he calls home is actually a gigantic soundstage. Truman's friends and family - everyone he meets, in fact - are actors. He lives every moment under the unblinking gaze of thousands of hidden TV cameras.
